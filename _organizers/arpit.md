<!---- Organizer bio below ------>
Arpit Agarwal  is a postdoctoral research scientist at FAIR, Meta. Before joining FAIR, he was a postdoctoral fellow at the Data Science Institute at Columbia University, and received his PhD in Computer & Information Sciences from the University of Pennsylvania. He is interested in understanding the interplay of human decision-making and recommendation systems-- how humans choose items based on recommendations and how we can learn their utility from their observed behavior, how recommendations influence the evolution of human tastes/preferences in the long-term, and how larger societal outcomes emerge from these individual interactions.
